PHYS 50733 - Assignment 4 Solutions

problem1.py computes the heat capacity as a function of the temperature T (K) 
for a 1000 cm^3 piece of solid aluminum with number density p=6.022e28 m^{-3} and 
a Debye temperature of 428 K. Uses the trapezoidal rule to perform the quadrature with 1000 sample points.
Generates a plot of the heat capacity for T=5 K to T=500 K.

problem2.py computes the integral of e^{t^2} from t=0 to t=x, as a function of x. We use the trapezoidal rule
to perform the quadrature, with 2000 slices. Generates a plot of this integral for x=0 to x=3.
